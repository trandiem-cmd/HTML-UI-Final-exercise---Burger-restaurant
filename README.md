This project was completed as part of the HTML and UI Design courses at OAMK University. It focuses on designing detailed mobile application views and implementing them using HTML and CSS.
The application represents a burger restaurant menu, with an emphasis on clear visual hierarchy and user-friendly mobile interfaces.
During the design phase, I created UI layouts in Figma to support all required functionalities and ensure a consistent user experience.
Figma prototype:

In the implementation phase, the design was translated into a functional website using Visual Studio Code, HTML, and CSS.
The final product was deployed publicly for online access.
Live website:

For the best user experience, the website is optimized for mobile devices and should be viewed on a smartphone.
